# Binary Prediction Neural Network

``` diff
+ Programming Language
Python


+ Explanation of Program
This program trains a neural network with the user-inputted data.

It also calculates the weights and biases of neurons with the Stochastic Gradient Descent
and predicts the output in a feedforward nature.


+ Caveats
- Run the main.py executable file to auto generate the MEMORY folder and NN_Mem.txt file initially
- Run this program via the main.py executable file directly


+ Modifications Made
- Implemented a feature which saves the current learn rate and epoch into local memory
- Implemented a feature which allows the user to modify the value of learn rate and epoch
- Implemented an automated log generation feature
- Created an additional helper function
- Added comments to the code for clarity
- Changed the GUI
